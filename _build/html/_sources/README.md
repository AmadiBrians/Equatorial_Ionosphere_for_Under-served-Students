This e-note, **Equatorial Ionosphere for Under-served Students: Tutorials and Codes**, presents the fundamental aspects of the equatorial ionosphere.  

Many excellent books have already discussed this fascinating topic, and several have made commendable efforts to simplify its complex concepts. 
 
However, this work is specifically designed to help **under-served students** — particularly those with difficult educational backgrounds (common in many parts of Africa) — gain a better grasp of the principles governing the equatorial ionosphere.  

The book assumes that readers have no advanced prior knowledge of ionospheric physics. Therefore, **undergraduate and graduate students**, including those who may have attended **ill-equipped schools in regions such as rural Africa**, can still understand and apply the ideas presented here.  

In essence, this book aims to serve as a **bridge between under-served students and established scientific texts**, providing both conceptual clarity and practical coding tutorials. 

Since this book consists of tutorials and codes, at the top of each note are python packages essential for running the codes embedded within.
